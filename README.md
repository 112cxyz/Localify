# Localify

Localify uses Spotipy to comunicate to Spotify

Localify is used to reduce the amounts of requests to spotify causing less rate limits.


Deskify & DeskThing (WIP) use Localify as a way to comunicate to spotify without causing rate limit issues.

# Localify Setup
```
# Localify uses flask to serve the API
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
